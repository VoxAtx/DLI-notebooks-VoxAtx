## Learning Objectives

The goals of this exercise include:
- Exploring how nueral networks use data to learn
- Understanding the math behind a neuron

## Prerequisites

Anyone can run the code to see how it works, but to get the most out of this content, we recommend:
- An understanding of fundamental programming concepts in [Python 3](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) such as functions, loops, dictionaries, and arrays.
- An understanding of how to
